		<h2>About My Art</h2>
		<p>My art is inspired by the natural world, particularly the textures and colors found in soil, rocks, and plants. I use a variety of media, including painting, sculpture, and mixed media, to explore these themes. My goal is to create pieces that evoke a sense of connection to the earth and encourage viewers to appreciate the beauty of the natural environment.</p>
